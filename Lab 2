;***************************** PERIPHERAL SETUP *******************************
	; We will use a technique called Read/Modify/Write Back. This is commonly
	; used when programming embedded application. Note that just writing our
	; wanted configuration may ruin the configuration for other pins/peripherals.
	; Reading what is in the peripheral register before modifying it allows us to
	; set our configuration whilst keeping previous configurations that shouldn't
	; be changed.
	; We encorage you to follow this practice, it will help you avoid crashes.

	LDR	R0,  [R1]  ; Read: RCC_AHB1ENR from mapped memory 
	ORR	R0,  #0x01 ; Modify: Set b0 to enable the clock for GPIOA
	STR	R0,  [R1]  ; Write Back: Write back to RCC_AHB1ENR
	; GPIOA is now enable but GPIOA.PIN5 must be configured
	; Deep dive: Comment out the Write Back operation and see what happens to
	; the MCU. HINT: You will end up in the hard fault handler, look the RCC_AHB1ENR
	; register in the datasheet and try to understand why the system fails

	LDR	R1,=GPIOA_MOD ;Load pointer for GPIOA mode
	LDR	R0, [R1]	; Read GPIOA mode register

	STR	R0, [R1, #GPIOA_OUT]	; Write back the output type	
	; GPIOA_PIN5 is now configured
	
	; Testing GPIOA_PIN5. To see this happening you must debug the lines that 
	; follow step by step, otherwise the LED will turn on then off in a matter 
	; of microseconds

; *****************************  CharToMorse  *********************************
; Input:  R0 Uppercase ASCII Char to be converted to Morse pattern (in Rn=R2)
; Output: Rn Returns the Morse code for input Char. You are free to chose what
;         register to use as output. Remember that post-processing of output 
;		  data occurs after returning to the caller
; WARNING: We provide basic stack/unstack operations but you must include any register
;		   you use that is not part of the subroutine output. For example, if you use
;		   R5 in your subroutine you must push R5, then pop R5 before you leave. 
;		   You will get an incomplete/zero mark if you fail to handle the stack 
;		   properly.

; Hint:   Each MorseLuT element is a half-word (16bits) index increments must
;		  be by steps of 2 bytes. Check LDR reference
CharToMorse
	STMFD	R13!,{R14} ; push Link Register (return address) on stack
		; Hint: An index is usually used to access data stored in memory as a 
		;       block of contigous memory containing elements of fixed size.
		;       e.g. Arrays such as MorseLut. Like when using arrays, here you will
		;       provide the base address and the index within the array.
		;		Check LDR reference for details on how to provide base+offset
		;		addresses
		
		; Hint: The char 'A' in the ASCII table is number 65 or 0x41 but the first
		;       element of an array is always at offset zero. Given a character
		;       you must map it to its corresponding offset within the Morse code
		;		think how to do this for 'A' first, then proceed to check it works
		;		for all other chars. Test with 'Z' to confirm you can reach the 
		;		right MorseCode pattern
		
		; Hint: Unsigned integer multiplication by a factor of 2^n is very fast
		;       and does not require a multiplier. Simply shift-left by n

; ******************************* TransmitMorse *******************************
; Input:  R0 Morse code pattern
; Output: No output
; WARNING: We provide basic stack/unstack operations but you must include any register
;		   you use that is not part of the subroutine output. For example, if you use
;		   R5 in your subroutine you must push R5, then pop R5 before you leave. 
;		   You will get an incomplete/zero mark if you fail to handle the stack 
;		   properly.

; Hint:   Note that to transmit the Morse code you must shift the pattern to remove 
;         the leading zeroes. Transmission begins once you find the first one in the
;		  sequence. You then process all the bits until the register is empty. Using
;         Logical Shift Left (LSL) you can shift the bits to the right.
; Hint:   LSL will move Rn[31] into the carry bit (C-flag), which you can then use to 
;         perform branches.
; Hint:   The calls to DelayN and ToggleLED are not there to show your were they go
;         it is just a friendly reminder you should use them within TransmitMorse and
;         to help you understand how calling and returning from subroutines work

; *********************************** LEDCtl **********************************
; Input:  R0 The value which indicates if the LED will be turned ON(1) or OFF (0)
; Output: No output
; WARNING: We provide basic stack/unstack operations but you must include any register
;		   you use that is not part of the subroutine output. For example, if you use
;		   R5 in your subroutine you must push R5, then pop R5 before you leave. 
;		   You will get an incomplete/zero mark if you fail to handle the stack 
;		   properly.
; Hint: C uses zero as false because most architectures will set Z=1 when the
;		result of an operation is zero. ARM is no exception to this method and
;       you can use MOVS to set Z=1 if you move a value of zero to a register,
;	    then you can branch or not by using BNE or BEQ depending on the status
;		the Z-flag. This can be very handy to decide if the LED should be ON/OFF

; Hint: Remember you implemented code to toggle an LED in Lab1.b you may
;		now be able to reuse that code for the LED control operation. Remember you
;		cannot assume registers are going to be preserved across your program so be
; 		careful on how you handle the GPIOA addresses. Look at the initialization 
;		for ideas on how to load addresses into registers.

; Input:  R0 DelayMultiplier. Assume R0>0          500ms*R0

; Hint:   Remember you implemented a 500ms delay in Lab1. Now you will transform
